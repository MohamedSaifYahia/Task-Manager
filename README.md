# Task Manager

## Description
The Task Manager is an intuitive web application designed to help users organize their tasks efficiently. Built with modern JavaScript technologies, this project utilizes Node.js, Express for the backend, and Handlebars as the templating engine for dynamic content rendering. It allows users to add tasks, prioritize them, and mark them as pinned for easy access. The application supports sorting tasks based on various criteria such as due date and priority, and filtering tasks by title or tags, making task management simpler and more effective.

## Features
